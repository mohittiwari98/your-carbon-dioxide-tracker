The Eco-Friendly Carbon Footprint Tracker is a web application that helps users calculate their annual carbon footprint based on lifestyle choices such as transportation, diet, energy consumption, flights, and waste production. Built as a single-page HTML application, it features a modern UI with Tailwind CSS, interactive charts using Chart.js, animations via Anime.js, and PDF report generation with jsPDF. This project is ideal for hackathons, educational purposes, or personal sustainability tracking.
